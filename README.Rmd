# AllSideR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of AllSideR is to provide you with the [AllSides.com](https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-ratings) Media Bias rating dataset.

From AllSides.com:

> Our Media Bias Ratings are determined using multiple methods and represent the average judgment of Americans. They are based on blind surveys of people across the political spectrum, multi-partisan analysis, editorial reviews, third party data, and tens of thousands of user feedback ratings. Our scientifically-generated ratings are fluid and subject to change as new information is gathered and biases change over time.

![](https://www.allsides.com/sites/default/files/AllSidesMediaBiasChart-Version1.1_0.jpg)

The dataset looks like this:

<!-- # ```{r} -->
<!-- # readRDS("data/allsides_data.RDS") %>%  -->
<!-- #   dplyr::select(news_source, rating, rating_num, type, agree, disagree, perc_agree, dplyr::everything(), -community_feedback) -> allsides_data -->
<!-- #  -->
<!-- # tidytemplate::save_it(allsides_data) -->
<!-- #  -->
<!-- # readr::write_csv(allsides_data, path = "data/allsides_data.csv") -->
<!-- #  -->
<!-- # usethis::use_data(allsides_data) -->
<!-- # ``` -->

## Get Dataset

Either Download data from GitHub Repo like this:

```{r}
allsides_data <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/favstats/AllSideR/master/data/allsides_data.csv")

allsides_data
```

Or install package and use it from there:

```{r, eval=F}
devtools::install_github("favstats/AllSideR")

## Access dataset from package
AllSideR::allsides_data
```



## Example Plots


```{r}
allsides_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rating_num, perc_agree)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth()
```

People agree more on bias of partisan media.

```{r}

  

allsides_data %>% 
  mutate(partisan = case_when(
    rating_num %in% c(2, 4) ~ "Slightly Partisan",
    rating_num %in% c(1, 5) ~ "Partisan",
    rating_num == 3 ~ "Center"
  )) %>% 
  drop_na(partisan) %>% 
  mutate(partisan = fct_relevel(partisan, c("Center", "Slightly Partisan", "Partisan"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(partisan, perc_agree)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.4)  +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2)
```

```{r}
allsides_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(rating_num, fill = type)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .4)
```

Lacks of right-wing media is filled by "Authors"?
