# AllSideR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of AllSideR is to provide you with the [AllSides.com](https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-ratings) Media Bias rating dataset.

From AllSides.com:

> Our Media Bias Ratings are determined using multiple methods and represent the average judgment of Americans. They are based on blind surveys of people across the political spectrum, multi-partisan analysis, editorial reviews, third party data, and tens of thousands of user feedback ratings. Our scientifically-generated ratings are fluid and subject to change as new information is gathered and biases change over time.

![](https://www.allsides.com/sites/default/files/AllSidesMediaBiasChart-Version1.1_0.jpg)

The dataset looks like this:

<!-- # ```{r} -->
<!-- # readRDS("data/allsides_data.RDS") %>%  -->
<!-- #   dplyr::select(news_source, rating, rating_num, type, agree, disagree, perc_agree, dplyr::everything(), -community_feedback) -> allsides_data -->
<!-- #  -->
<!-- # tidytemplate::save_it(allsides_data) -->
<!-- #  -->
<!-- # readr::write_csv(allsides_data, path = "data/allsides_data.csv") -->
<!-- #  -->
<!-- # usethis::use_data(allsides_data) -->
<!-- # ``` -->

+ `news_source`: Rated entity 
+ `rating`: AllSides Rating (left, left-center, center, right-center, right, allsides)
+ `rating_num`: Same as `rating` but numeric (from left to right, excluding "allsides" rating)
+ `type`: News entity type (can be news media, author or think tank/policy group)
+ `agree`: Number of people who agree with the rating
+ `disagree`: Number of people who disagree with the rating
+ `perc_agree`: Percentage of people who agree with the rating
+ `url`: URL with more Info
+ `editorial_review`: Was there an editorial review of the rating? (0/1)
+ `blind_survey`: Blind survey conducted? (0/1)
+ `third_party_analysis`: Based on third-party analysis? (0/1)
+ `independent_research`: Based on ndependent research? (0/1)
+ `confidence_level`: The confidence of the rating (Low or Initial Rating	, Medium, High)
+ `twitter`: URL to Twitter account (when provided)
+ `wiki`: URL to Wikipedia article (when provided)
+ `facebook`: URL to Facebook page (when provided)

## Get Dataset

Either Download data from GitHub Repo like this:

```{r}
allsides_data <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/favstats/AllSideR/master/data/allsides_data.csv")

allsides_data
```

Or install package and use it from there:

```{r, eval=F}
devtools::install_github("favstats/AllSideR")

## Access dataset from package
AllSideR::allsides_data
```



## Example Plots

How does rating relate to agreement of the rating?


```{r}
allsides_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rating_num, perc_agree*100)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = "AllSides Media Bias Rating (Left to Right)", y = "% Agree",
       title = "AllSides Media Bias Rating X Agreement with Rating",
       caption = "Source: AllSides.com") +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = allsides_data %>% filter(perc_agree*100 > 80, rating_num %in% c(1:5)), 
                           aes(label = news_source)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

People agree more on the bias of partisan media.

```{r}
allsides_data %>% 
  mutate(partisan = case_when(
    rating_num %in% c(2, 4) ~ "Slightly Partisan",
    rating_num %in% c(1, 5) ~ "Partisan",
    rating_num == 3 ~ "Center"
  )) %>% 
  drop_na(partisan) %>% 
  mutate(partisan = fct_relevel(partisan, c("Center", "Slightly Partisan", "Partisan"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(partisan, perc_agree*100)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.4)  +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2)  +
  labs(x = "AllSides Media Bias Rating", y = "% Agree",
       title = "AllSides Media Bias Rating X Agreement with Rating",
       caption = "Source: AllSides.com") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Finally, let's take a look at the distribution of bias by source `type`.

```{r}
allsides_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(rating_num, fill = type)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")  +
  labs(x = "AllSides Media Bias Rating (Left to Right)", y = "Density",
       title = "AllSides Media Bias Rating",
       caption = "Source: AllSides.com")  
```

Lack of right-wing media is filled by "Author" category. Would be worth investigating.
